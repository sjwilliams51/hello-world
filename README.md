This is my first repository
Hello everyone!

I am learning github and will be using alot of unfamilar applications and sites for the Coursera course on HTML programming.  All I really want to do it learn enough to write Office 365 addins, but ut appears that I am stuck learning all of this stuff, which seems to be a wate of time.
